        <p>Iâ€™m a developer with a sweet twist. I use JavaScript, React and Ruby on Rails to build applications. My experience is a combination of chocolate and baking with the discipline of military service. Quality, time-management, and commitment are my top three values. And just like chocolate and pastry, code can become very complex with a sweet reward. Challenging myself is what I thrive on.</p>
