        <p>Hello! I’m Patsy, a developer with a sweet twist. My experience is a combination of chocolate and baking with the discipline of military service. Quality, time-management, and commitment are my top three values. And just like chocolate and pastry, code can become very complex with a sweet reward. Challenging myself is what I thrive on. I’m excited to see how I can improve the pastry world using software development.</p>
